Sort of. You can subscribe to gain access to all Coursesuite apps through the https://www.coursesuite.com web site, which gives you access to the Coursesuite API. This lets you sign in and launch apps from registered integrations, or you can write your own. Registering an integration also enables publishing of packages directly to your learning platform. API automation of conversion features are not supported at this time (but might be down the track).
