Your learners need a modern browser that is supported by your LMS. Usually that means anything better and newer than Internet Explorer 11, such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari or so on.

<div uk-grid class="uk-child-width-1-3">
<img src="assets/deliver.svg" height="50">
<img src="assets/firefox.svg" height="50">
<img src="assets/chrome.svg" height="50">
<img src="assets/opera.svg" height="50">
<img src="assets/safari.svg" height="50">
<img src="assets/edge.svg" height="50">
</div>

Internet Explorer 11 will work, probably. Or it might catch fire. If you can update, <em>please do</em>.
